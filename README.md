### Rafael Cóias

Hi, my name is Rafael Cóias.

📚️  I am currently taking a Computer Science and Engineering degree at ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon. 

💻️  I'm also a student at 42 Lisbon, where I've been developing a lot of programming and software skills.

🔐️  In September 2022 I finished CCNA, a Cisco's Cybersecurity course where I learned networking, routing and (of course) cybersecurity.

I am looking forward to finish my Iscte degree and 42 course in 2023 and start to work as a Full Stack Developer.
