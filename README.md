### Rafael Cóias

Hi, my name is Rafael Cóias.

📚️  I am currently studying Computer Science and Engenering degree in ISCTE - University Institute of Lisbon. 

💻️  I'm also a student at 42 Lisbon where I've been developing a lot of programming and software skills.

🔐️  In September 2022 I finished CCNA, a Cisco's Cibersecurity course where I learned networking, routing and (of course) cibersecurity.

I am looking forward to end my Iscte degree and 42 course in 2023 and start working as a Full Stack Developer.
